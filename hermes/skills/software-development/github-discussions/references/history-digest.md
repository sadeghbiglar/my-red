# Status digest from repo history

A "what happened recently" discussion post. The point is a decision thread, not a changelog dump.

## Gather (run all; each number in the post comes from one of these)

```bash
# What landed, per PR, with the curated title
gh pr list -R OWNER/REPO --state merged --limit 20 \
  --json number,title,mergedAt,author --jq '.[] | "\(.number) | \(.mergedAt[0:10]) | \(.author.login) | \(.title)"'

# In-flight work
gh pr list -R OWNER/REPO --state open --json number,title

# Backlog
gh issue list -R OWNER/REPO --state open --json number,title

# Work not yet in a PR, per author — only refs backed by a configured remote.
# `--all` includes remote-tracking refs whose remote was deleted, so it reports
# work as "recent" that exists nowhere anyone can reach. Use origin/BRANCH.
git log origin/BRANCH --no-merges --since=<date> --pretty='%cs %an %s'

# Divergence — only for a ref backed by a configured remote
git remote -v
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/BRANCH...HEAD
```

### Anchor the window to the branch tip, not to the thread

"the last 24 hours" is measured from now. Start at the tip commit and subtract, rather than
using the thread's creation time as the boundary — the question's timestamp is not the window,
and the count comes out wrong in whichever direction the two differ.

```bash
git log -1 --format=%H origin/BRANCH                      # what "now" is
git log --no-merges --since="24 hours ago" origin/BRANCH
git log -1 --format=%H --before="<since>" origin/BRANCH   # boundary commit for the diffstat
git diff --shortstat <boundary> origin/BRANCH
```

Name the anchor in the post. Report merges separately from non-merges: a busy day has far more
of one than the other, and a single number covering both reads as either a much larger or a
much smaller day than it actually was.

Prefer `gh pr list --state merged` over parsing `git log --merges` for the narrative: merge subjects are boilerplate ("Merge pull request #N from …") and carry no intent, while a PR title is already the curated summary of its commits.

## Structure

1. **Title carries the window** ("… — <date range>"), so the thread is self-describing in a list view.
2. **Group by theme, not by author and not by date.** A reader asks "what changed in the product". Theme headings are things like quality/stability, domain features, integrations, API contracts, docs. Conventional-commit scopes in the PR titles already tell you the themes — read them off rather than inventing categories.
3. **Inline the PR number as an anchor** after each item. It is a citation, not the content.
4. **Current state section:** open issues (say "none open" explicitly — an empty list IS the status), test counts, branch sync.
5. **One proposed next step**, with a decision or an owner attached. End with a question; a discussion exists to be answered.

## Pitfalls

- Do not restate a PR title you did not read. One-line it, and keep the title's own vocabulary.
- A branch that is in sync is a claim about the push target, which is a specific configured remote — say which one or drop the claim.
- Do not report test-suite counts from memory or from a docs file; run the suite or the count command, otherwise omit the figure.
- Do not list raw commit subjects from `git log --all` for work that already shipped in a PR — that produces duplicate entries under two different headings.
